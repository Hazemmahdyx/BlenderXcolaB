1- cycles & cycles-X engine ONLY  - In fact, you can use Eevee engine, but the process is a bit complicated because Eevee needs a pop-up screen and this is not available in Google Colab, but there is a way to get it, but compared to your device, it is better to work on your device in this case.

2- only 12 hours straight  - Since the connection to the graphics card begins, the countdown to the number of hours available to work on Google Collab begins, and they are approximately 12 hours. If you consume 3 hours, for example, and then stop the process, you still have 9 hours left .. But do not worry, the period is renewed approximately every two days, but in fact, no one knows about the renewal date and whether it is renewed by 12 hours as well or 6 hours, but do not ruin this method by using it every day and you will not find any problem.
